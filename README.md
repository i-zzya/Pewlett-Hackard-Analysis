# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

For this project Bobby and I were tasked to help prepare his manager for the "Silver Tsunami". We were to determine the number of retiring employees according to their title/department and to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Once the data is collected we summarized our analysis to help our stakeholders make the best decisions moving forward. 

## Results
