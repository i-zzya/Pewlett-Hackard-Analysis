# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

For this project Bobby and I were tasked to help prepare his manager for the "Silver Tsunami". We were to determine the number of retiring employees according to their title/department and to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Once the data is collected we summarized our analysis to help our stakeholders make the best decisions moving forward. 

## Results

### The Number of Retiring Employees by Title

Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
